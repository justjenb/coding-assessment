# coding-assessment

## Description

As a student and technology professional with a decade of experience, creating a coding assessment webpage has been an excellent way to challenge myself and showcase my coding skills. This project has allowed me to practice problem-solving, algorithm development, and code optimization. 

Building this coding assessment webpage has given me the opportunity to design, develop, and deploy a complete web application using JavaScript. In creating this project it has helped me grow as a developer and continue learning more about web design.
